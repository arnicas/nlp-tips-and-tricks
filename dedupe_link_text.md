## Links on Deduplication and Entity Norming


A [repo by heathersherry with links on Entity Resolution, Matching, and Alignment](https://github.com/heathersherry/Knowledge-Graph-Tutorials-and-Papers/blob/master/topics/Entity%20Resolution%2C%20Entity%20Matching%20and%20Entity%20Alignment.md)

[String_grouper](https://github.com/Bergvca/string_grouper) - a tool I like. No ui though.

[Open Refine](https://openrefine.org/) offers UI and review of grouped strings, plus multiple algorithms.  If you can remember what you want the norm form to be, this is a step up in terms of speed of management of this problem.

[csvdedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe) - interface to dedupe python lib

[text-dedup](https://github.com/ChenghaoMou/text-dedup) - big data methods using locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and relatives

[cargo](https://github.com/google-research/deduplicate-text-datasets) - in Rust for ExactSubstrings quickly, from google research

[code used by BigScience team](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/data-preparation/blob/main/preprocessing/training/01b_oscar_cleaning_and_filtering/deduplicate/self_deduplicate.py)

[Record Linkage Resources](https://github.com/ropeladder/record-linkage-resources) - ropeladder list of resources

Want to replace string equivalents to normalize your strings, efficiently?  I like [FlashText](https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext).
