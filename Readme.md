# NLP Tips and Tricks

## Talk slides from NormConf

This repo is a WIP!  I'm moving things into it :) It started from a talk I gave at Normconf on NLP tips and tricks, based on some recent client projects (but I mostly used representative fake data in the talk).

My talk slides are here:
[https://ghostweather.slides.com/lynncherny/nlp-tips-tricks](https://ghostweather.slides.com/lynncherny/nlp-tips-tricks)
The video (shorter than the slides, I didn't have time to cover it all) is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=2s).

## Weak Supervision

[skweak](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skweak) will work with spaCy.
There is even a spaCy project example.

[Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) (formerly Rubrix): I like the elastic-search-based rule creation process, it's fast.

[Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/use-cases/01-spam-tutorial) -- but the project has turned into a company and so the docs are a bit all over
