Related libs: [bulk](https://github.com/koaning/bulk) by Vincent Warmerdam, [umap](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) from Leland McInnes, [ThisNotThat](https://github.com/TutteInstitute/thisnotthat) by Leland McInnes and Benoit Hamelin (in progress)


## Weak Supervision

[skweak](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/skweak) will work with spaCy.
There is even a spaCy project example.

[Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) (formerly Rubrix): I like the elastic-search-based rule creation process, it's fast.

[Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/use-cases/01-spam-tutorial) -- but the project has turned into a company and so the docs are a bit all over
